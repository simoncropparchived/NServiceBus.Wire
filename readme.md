## Usage

<!-- snippet: WireSerialization -->
<a id='snippet-wireserialization'/></a>
```cs
endpointConfiguration.UseSerialization<WireSerializer>();
```
<sup>[snippet source](/src/Tests/Snippets/Usage.cs#L9-L13) / [anchor](#snippet-wireserialization)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->

This serializer does not support [messages defined as interfaces](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/messaging/messages-as-interfaces). If an explicit interface is sent, an exception will be thrown with the following message:

```
Interface based message are not supported.
Create a class that implements the desired interface
```

Instead, use a public class with the same contract as the interface. The class can optionally implement any required interfaces.


### Custom settings

Customizes the instance of `SerializerOptions` used for serialization.

<!-- snippet: WireCustomSettings -->
<a id='snippet-wirecustomsettings'/></a>
```cs
var options = new SerializerOptions(
    preserveObjectReferences: true);
var serialization = endpointConfiguration.UseSerialization<WireSerializer>();
serialization.Options(options);
```
<sup>[snippet source](/src/Tests/Snippets/Usage.cs#L18-L25) / [anchor](#snippet-wirecustomsettings)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->


### Custom content key

When using [additional deserializers](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/serialization/#specifying-additional-deserializers) or transitioning between different versions of the same serializer it can be helpful to take explicit control over the content type a serializer passes to NServiceBus (to be used for the [ContentType header](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/messaging/headers#serialization-headers-nservicebus-contenttype)).

<!-- snippet: WireContentTypeKey -->
<a id='snippet-wirecontenttypekey'/></a>
```cs
var serialization = endpointConfiguration.UseSerialization<WireSerializer>();
serialization.ContentTypeKey("custom-key");
```
<sup>[snippet source](/src/Tests/Snippets/Usage.cs#L30-L35) / [anchor](#snippet-wirecontenttypekey)</sup>
